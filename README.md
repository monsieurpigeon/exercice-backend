# Exercice Backend Accelerator App

## Assessment

Develop a Node.Js api that allows a client app to :
- Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem.
- Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result.
- Cater for a large directory size ( at least 100 000).
- Make sure the application is containerized and can run on any system.

You can use REST or Graphql. We are a Graphql company, but if you donâ€™t know it yet then I would suggest you use what you know best.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
- nodejs
- docker

## Running the application

1. To run the API on port 49160 :

```
docker-compose run web
```

2. You can access the API UI on your browser at :
```
localhost:49160/graphql
```

3. Query the API using this test query :
```graphql
{
  files(path: "filesystem"){
    path
    size
    attributes {
      lastRead
      lastUpdate
      lastMetadataUpdate
      birthTime
      isFile
      isDirectory
      isSymbolicLink
    }
  }
}

```
