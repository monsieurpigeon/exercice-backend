# Exercice Backend Accelerator App

## Assessment

Develop a Node.Js api that allows a client app to :
- Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem.
- Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result.
- Cater for a large directory size ( at least 100 000).
- Make sure the application is containerized and can run on any system.

You can use REST or Graphql. We are a Graphql company, but if you donâ€™t know it yet then I would suggest you use what you know best.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
- nodejs 
- docker >20.0

### On a mac

Make sure to allow full disk access to docker.app

## Running the application

1. Generate the filesystem :
```
sh script/generateFilesystem.sh
```

2. Run the API and expose it on port 49160 :

```
docker-compose up
```

3. You can access the API UI on your browser at :
```
localhost:49160/graphql
```

4. Query the API using this test query :
```graphql
{
  files(path: ""){
    path
    size
    attributes {
      lastRead
      lastUpdate
      lastMetadataUpdate
      birthTime
      isFile
      isDirectory
      isSymbolicLink
    }
  }
}

```
